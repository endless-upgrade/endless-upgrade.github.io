### Personal and Soft Skill

#### Research Interests
I strongly believe in the power of deep learning to better understand and model humans' behaviour. I want to do my best to create a future where robots and humans can live together. I moved from my previous work in a company because I realised that I want to spend my abilities for something that matters.

#### Curious and Practical-Oriented
I am a really curious person, always eager to acquire new skills and discover "how things work". I love to work both on high level designs and low level projects: during master degree I developed a raspberry-based differential drive robot able to autonomously explore and navigate a unknown environment; in this first year of Ph.D. I developed a controller for iCub's eyelids, making it able to wink, and a hack of Keepon to control it via YARP both based on Arduino Uno. I'm definitely going to use them for my future researches.

#### Not just me
I always do my best to help colleagues, sharing my knowledge, giving advices and doing my work taking into account a future extension. I'm  tutoring some bachelor students and I always push them in the discovery of the knowledge behind the problems.

#### Autonomous and Organised
The internship experiences, along with the actual PhD research, allowed me to develop an high level of autonomy and organisation, making me able to follow several parallel projects, set my own goals, take conscious risks and flexibly adapt to unexpected issues.

### Interests and Activities
I'm an homebrewer and I produce my own beer, IPA and Stout are my favourite styles. I usually follow the same approach I use during research, every time I try new techniques in order to improve my knowledge. I also enjoy cooking and make  handmade traditional pasta like tortellini. I'm a dungeon master and I love to create amazing stories and plots. To improve my interaction abilities I'm attending a theatrical improvisation course.
