<div style="text-align: justify">
For most people magicians seem to surpass human abilities, combining skills and deception to perform mesmerizing tricks. Robots performing magic tricks could similarly fascinate and engage the audience, potentially establishing a novel rapport with human partners. However, magician robots are usually done by Wizard of Oz. Tis study presents an autonomous framework to perform a magic trick in a quick and game-like human-robot interaction. Te iCub humanoid robot plays the role of a magician in a card game, autonomously inferring which card the human partner is lying about. We exploited cognitive load assessment via pupil reading to infer the mental state of the player. Te validation results show an accuracy of 90.9% and the possibility to simplify the game to improve its portability. Tis suggests the feasibility of our approach and paves the way toward a real-world application of the game.

Detecting lies in a real-world scenario is an important skill for a humanoid robot that aims to act as a teacher, a therapist, or a caregiver. In these contexts, it is essential to detect lies while preserving the pleasantness of the social interaction and the informality of the relation. This study investigates whether pupil dilation related to an increase in cognitive load can be used to swiftly identify a lie in an entertaining scenario. The iCub humanoid robot plays the role of a magician in a card game, telling which card the human partner is lying about. The results show a greater pupil dilation in presence of a false statement even if in front of a robot and without the need of a strictly controlled scenario. We developed a heuristic method (accuracy of 71.4% against 16.6% chance level) and a random forest classifier (precision and recall of 83.3%) to detect the false statement. Additionally, the current work suggests a potential method to assess the lying strategy of the partner.

**Abstract**<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Deception is a complex social skill present in human interactions. Many social professions such as teachers, therapists and law enforcement officers leverage on deception detection techniques to support their work activities. Robots with the ability to autonomously detect deception could provide an important aid to human-human and human-robot interactions. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the possibility to develop a lie detection system that could be implemented on robots. To this goal, we focus on human and human robot interaction to understand if there is a difference in the behavior of the participants when lying to a robot or to a human. Participants were shown short movies of robberies and then interrogated by a human and by a humanoid robot “detectives.” According to the instructions, subjects provided veridical responses to half of the question and false replies to the other half. Behavioral variables such as eye movements, time to respond and eloquence were measured during the task, while personality traits were assessed before experiment initiation. Participant's behavior showed strong similarities during the interaction with the human and the humanoid. Moreover, the behavioral features were used to train and test a lie detection algorithm. The results show that the selected behavioral variables are valid markers of deception both in human-human and in human-robot interactions and could be exploited to effectively enable robots to detect lies.
