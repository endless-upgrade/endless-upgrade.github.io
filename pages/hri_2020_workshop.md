### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">
For most people magicians seem to surpass human abilities, combining skills and deception to perform mesmerizing tricks. Robots performing magic tricks could similarly fascinate and engage the audience, potentially establishing a novel rapport with human partners. However, magician robots are usually done by Wizard of Oz. Tis study presents an autonomous framework to perform a magic trick in a quick and game-like human-robot interaction. Te iCub humanoid robot plays the role of a magician in a card game, autonomously inferring which card the human partner is lying about. We exploited cognitive load assessment via pupil reading to infer the mental state of the player. Te validation results show an accuracy of 90.9% and the possibility to simplify the game to improve its portability. Tis suggests the feasibility of our approach and paves the way toward a real-world application of the game.
